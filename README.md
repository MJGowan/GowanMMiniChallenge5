Mini Challenge 5 - Redo
In this program we have to create a MadLib, allowing the user to input various words which will then combine together cleanly into a story.

Review by Daniel Decoito: Everything works as intended but there are a few issues. First I felt that the user experience is not taken into consideration. It works as a project because it meets the base criteria but more could have been implemented to make the user more aware of what theyre supposed to do. Perhaps explain to them the rules of madlibs and inform them that they are supposed to type in responses to specific console prompts. Second, nothing was added to improve the base code since the initial assignment was given. A good suggestion would be using string interplotion to make the code cleaner. Finally, the loop mechanisim has issues. If you put in an incorrect Character you will be prompted to renter the character correctly. However, whatever the user inputs, correct or incorrect, will cause the game to terminate. I think the issue is due to the if statment that triggers the terminate game being outside the while loop.  


Response by Madeline Gowan: I did my best to take this advice and make my program better in terms of user experience, by explaining the code and the program as well as adding friendlier responses. I adjusted the if statements and while loop to hopefully fix the issue with the game being terminated. I also used string interpolation to clean up the code, as suggested. Thank you very much for the review! It helped a lot.
